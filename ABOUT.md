## What is HTML?

HTML is a markup language and stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

HTML will define the content of a webpage. (text, images, videos)

HTML helps you structure your page into elements such as paragraphs, sections, headings, navigation bars, and so on. It is not a programming language like C or Java, there are no variables, functions, classes, etc.

Examples of HTML tags:

- Level 1 heading `<h1>`
- Level 2 heading `<h2>`
- Level 3 heading `<h3>`
- A paragraph `<p>`
- Section of a page `<div>`
- Inline section of a page `<span>`
- An order/unordered list with numbered/bullet points  `<ol>`/`<ul>` with `<li>`
- An input (text, dropdown, button, etc.) `<input>`
- And the whole body of the page `<body>`

## What is CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS defines the styling of your webpage like colors and spacing of HTML elements.

To access these elements, you have to "select" them. You can select a single or multiple web elements and specify how you want them to look or be positioned.

Access all tags using just the `tag name`:
```css
h1 {
    ...
}
```

Access one by `id`: (`#`)
```css
#image-id {
    ...
}
```
Access by `class`: (`.`)
```css
.card {
    ...
}
```

## What is JavaScript?

Now, if HTML is the markup language and CSS is the design language, then JavaScript is the programming language.

You can program your web page or individual elements to react a certain way and to do something when something else **(an event)** happens.

You can program actions, conditions, calculations, network requests, concurrent tasks and many other kinds of instructions.

You can access any elements through the Document Object Model API (DOM) and make them change however you want them to.

# Beyond the Basics

## CSS Frameworks

CSS frameworks are tools used by UI developers to make their job easier. Rather than reinventing the wheel each time a new project comes up; frameworks give developers the tools to quickly spin-up user interfaces that can be tweaked and iterated on throughout a project instead of spending time starting from a blank document.

In its simplest form, a CSS framework is a collection of CSS stylesheets that are prepped and ready to use. They're tailored for use in common situations, like setting up navbars, and are often expanded upon by other technologies such as SASS and JavaScript. 

Time savings aren’t the only benefit gained by using CSS frameworks. Teams with multiple developers, especially larger ones, can really appreciate the standards that frameworks bring to the table. 

Most common CSS Frameworks:
- Bootstrap
- Tailwind CSS
- Foundation
- Bulma
- Skeleton

## JavaScript Frameworks

JavaScript frameworks provide developers with the basic foundation necessary for building JavaScript applications. This saves developers the effort of starting from scratch by utilizing a functional base to get things rolling. Most frameworks aid in the handling of data and events within a web application.

JavaScript frameworks are an essential part of modern front-end web development, providing developers with tried and tested tools for building scalable, interactive web applications. Many modern companies use frameworks as a standard part of their tooling, so many front-end development jobs now require framework experience.

Most common front-end JavaScript frameworks:
- React
- Angular
- Vue

## Backend Frameworks

Backend frameworks are the libraries of server-side languages that aid in building the server configuration of any website. Backend frameworks allow for templating, database access, and session management and are necessary for building a modern web app.

Most common backend frameworks:
- Django (Python)
- Express.js (JavaScript)
- Flask (Python)
- Spring (Java)
- Laravel (PHP)
- Ruby on Rails
